The main die file is created to simulate a standard six sided die. The die can be rolled like a standard die. It is also possible to look at the top of the die, so that multiple dies can be rolled at once, and then looked at a later date.
Test die is used in order to make sure that the die class is functioning properly. Test Roll rolls 1 die 1000 time, then gives the probably of how many of each number was seen. This tests randomness and shows that the die has similar probability to 1/6 for each number. TestGetTop makes sure that when the die is rolled you can look at the top and get the same number.
The numbers seen on all sides in not exactly 0.166 or (1/6). This is because the sample size is only 1000. This shows that it performs similar to a real die. When testing a loaded die, it should be obvious every time the die is rolled that one side is showing up more than others.
