The user of this application said that their should be rules provided. Overall the GUI was easy to use and intuitive creating a loaded die was a little more complicated. The user thought it would be a good idea to impliment a high score functionality. 
The application was given with no instruction, when asked the rules they were explained. Functionality was pretty strait forward.
